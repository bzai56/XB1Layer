# Findings: Forza Horizon 3 kiosk demo

Package: `Kiosk-Opus_1.0.0.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe` (unpacked Xbox One app, tested locally; not distributed here).

## Layout
- `forza_durango_release_final.exe` (~74 MB): plain x64 PE, loads without any decryption step.
- `AppxManifest.xml`: Xbox manifest (`mx:ApplicationEnvironment=title`, `OSName=era`), single app `ReleaseFinal`, GPU availability `variable`.
- Bundled DLLs: `Microsoft.Xbox.Services.dll` (~20 MB), `Microsoft.Xbox.GameChat.dll`, `Microsoft.Xbox.Input.Wheel.dll`, `commonEventLoggingLibrary_release.dll`, `psapi.dll`.
- `media/`: not yet inspected.

## Loader results (load-only)
- 16 sections, mapped at the preferred base `0x140000000`.
- 569 imports resolved natively, 171 stubbed.

## Console-only DLLs (not present on Windows)
| DLL | Role |
|-----|------|
| `kernelx.dll` | Console kernel API (memory, threading, system queries) |
| `d3d11_x.dll` | Console D3D11 variant: this title is D3D11.X, not D3D12.X |
| `xg_x.dll` | Xbox graphics helper (texture/resource layout) |
| `EtwPlus.dll` | Event tracing extensions |
| `AcpHal.dll` | Audio hardware abstraction |
| `commonEventLoggingLibrary_Release.dll` | Ships in the package folder; likely loadable once the DLL search path includes it |

## Import breakdown (initial 171 stubs)
Full list: [fh3-stubbed-imports-initial.txt](fh3-stubbed-imports-initial.txt).

| DLL | Stubbed | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `kernelx.dll` | 138 | All but 6 are standard Win32 names (`CreateFileW`, `EnterCriticalSection`, fibers, SRW locks, ...) |
| `commonEventLoggingLibrary_Release.dll` | 9 | C++ mangled exports; still fails to load because its own dependencies are console DLLs |
| `AcpHal.dll` | 8 | Audio processor heap and shape contexts (`Apu*`, `AcpHal*`) |
| `xg_x.dll` | 7 | Texture layout and tile-mode computation (`XGCompute*`, `XGCreateTexture*Computer`) |
| `EtwPlus.dll` | 4 | `Etx*` tracing: safe to no-op |
| `d3d11_x.dll` | 4 | `D3D11XCreateDeviceX`, `D3DMapEsramMemory`, `DXGIXPresentArray`, `DXGIXSetVLineNotification` |
| `MMDevAPI.DLL` | 1 | `SetWasapiThreadAffinityMask` |

## After aliasing `kernelx.dll` to `kernel32.dll`
Stubs drop from 171 to 39 (701 resolved natively). Remaining `kernelx` stubs, the genuinely console-specific ones:
`TitleMemoryStatus`, `XMemAlloc`, `XMemAllocDefault`, `XMemFree`, `XMemFreeDefault`, `XMemSetAllocationHooks`.

Caveat: aliasing resolves names only. Console semantics can differ (for example `VirtualAlloc` page sizes and large pages), so behavior will need checking once the title actually runs.

The GPU surface is small by import count: only 4 `d3d11_x` entry points are imported directly. The rest of the D3D11.X API is reached through the device object that `D3D11XCreateDeviceX` returns, so the shim will need to wrap that device and its interfaces.

## First runs (`--run`)
Calling the entry point after the process bootstrap (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)) gets the title through CRT startup and a long stretch of static initialization (20,000+ traced API calls) before it dies. What it took to get there, in order:

1. **Stack size.** The title overflowed Rust's 1 MB main-thread stack and died silently. Running it on a 256 MB-reserve thread fixed the random hangs and crashes.
2. **Console `VirtualAlloc` flags.** The title reserves seven large regions at fixed addresses (for example `0x60000000000` for 12 GiB, `0x800000000`, `0x900400000`) with allocation-type bits that desktop Windows rejects with `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`: `0x40000000` and `0x10000000` (plus `0x20000000`, large pages). With every reservation failing, its pool allocator computed `size / element_size = 0`, called `HeapAlloc(0)` and then looped on `count - 1`. Stripping the unsupported bits and keeping the address hint fixed this; all seven reservations now succeed at the requested addresses, and later commits use `0x40000000` as well.
3. **Static TLS on every thread.** The title uses `__declspec(thread)` and starts worker threads. Threads created through `CreateThread` now get their own TLS block via a trampoline.
4. **`XMemSetAllocationHooks`** is the first console-only stub the title actually calls, and it returns 0.

## Where it stops now
The process ends with exit code `0xC000027B` (`STATUS_STOWED_EXCEPTION`). One earlier run ended in `0xC0000409` instead; I did not find out why, and later runs all gave `0xC000027B`. Found with the crash-proof ring trace (`--ring=`, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)):

1. The title is a **C++/CX (WinRT) app**: it imports `vccorlib140.dll` and `combase.dll`.
2. It first looks for `g:\hash.manifest`. `G:` is the console's game-content drive, which does not exist here, so `GetFileAttributesExA` and `FindFirstFileExA("g:\*")` fail with `ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND`. It then falls back to `.\hash.manifest` (found because the working directory is the title folder).
3. It activates `Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication` (`ICoreApplication`, IID `0AACF7A4-5E1D-49DF-8034-FB6A68BC5ED1`) successfully through the real Windows runtime.
4. It then reads `hash.manifest` as 12-byte records (an 8-byte hash and a `0xFFFFFFFF` marker) and stops after about 100 of the file's roughly 2,260 records.
5. A WinRT call returns `E_INVALIDARG`. The C++/CX HRESULT-to-exception mapper at `title+0x227454` raises `Platform::InvalidArgumentException`, nothing catches it, and the title calls `RoFailFastWithErrorContext` from `title+0x2859bcf`.

**What is established:** the title fail-fasts on an uncaught `E_INVALIDARG` WinRT exception, after activating `CoreApplication` and while reading `hash.manifest`.

**What is not established:** which WinRT call returned `E_INVALIDARG`. WinRT method calls go through COM vtables, not through imports, so the API trace cannot see them. A reasonable guess is that the title runs inside the real `CoreApplication`, whose view and window objects do not exist for an unpackaged desktop process, but that has not been verified.

## Next investigation steps
1. Provide our own WinRT layer for the UWP shell (`CoreApplication`, `CoreApplicationView`, `CoreWindow`, dispatcher) backed by a native window, so the title's `IFrameworkView` callbacks (`Initialize`, `SetWindow`, `Load`, `Run`) run under our control and failures become visible.
2. Wrap WinRT objects the title receives so their method calls are traceable.
3. Provide a `G:` equivalent: map the title folder as the content root instead of relying on the working directory.
4. Implement `XMem*` and `TitleMemoryStatus`.
5. Inspect `media/` to see whether content is plain or encrypted (encrypted content is out of scope).
6. Work out which D3D11.X-only interfaces and methods the title calls on the returned device.
