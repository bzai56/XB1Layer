# Findings: Forza Horizon 3 kiosk demo

Package: `Kiosk-Opus_1.0.0.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe` (unpacked Xbox One app, tested locally; not distributed here).

## Layout
- `forza_durango_release_final.exe` (~74 MB): plain x64 PE, loads without any decryption step.
- `AppxManifest.xml`: Xbox manifest (`mx:ApplicationEnvironment=title`, `OSName=era`), single app `ReleaseFinal`, GPU availability `variable`.
- Bundled DLLs: `Microsoft.Xbox.Services.dll` (~20 MB), `Microsoft.Xbox.GameChat.dll`, `Microsoft.Xbox.Input.Wheel.dll`, `commonEventLoggingLibrary_release.dll`, `psapi.dll`.
- `media/`: not yet inspected.

## Loader results (load-only)
- 16 sections, mapped at the preferred base `0x140000000`.
- 569 imports resolved natively, 171 stubbed.

## Console-only DLLs (not present on Windows)
| DLL | Role |
|-----|------|
| `kernelx.dll` | Console kernel API (memory, threading, system queries) |
| `d3d11_x.dll` | Console D3D11 variant: this title is D3D11.X, not D3D12.X |
| `xg_x.dll` | Xbox graphics helper (texture/resource layout) |
| `EtwPlus.dll` | Event tracing extensions |
| `AcpHal.dll` | Audio hardware abstraction |
| `commonEventLoggingLibrary_Release.dll` | Ships in the package folder; likely loadable once the DLL search path includes it |

## Next investigation steps
1. Dump the full list of 171 stubbed names, grouped by DLL.
2. Add the package folder to the DLL search path and re-check which imports still stub.
3. Inspect `media/` to see whether content is plain or encrypted (encrypted content is out of scope).
